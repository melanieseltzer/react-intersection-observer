# React Intersection Observer

Playing with the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) using React. For this particular component we're using Intersection Observer to highlight the nav item when the corresponding page section is in view ðŸ‘Œ

Intersection Observer is a very useful API which allows a callback to be called whenever an element 'intersects' either the device viewport or a specified element.

The possibilities are quite endless, for example:

- Navigation changes reflected when viewing specific content
- Lazy loading images
- Infinite scrolling
- Sticky nav after scrolling
