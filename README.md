# React Intersection Observer

React components that make use of the very useful [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). Intersection Observer allows a callback to be called whenever an element 'intersects' either the device viewport or a specified element.

The possibilities are quite endless, for example:

- Navigation changes reflected when scrolling down through different sections of the page
- Lazy loading images
- Infinite scrolling
- Sticky nav after scrolling
